# Kusikusi

Kusikusi is a Lumen based headless CMS with a head. A boilerplate for creating API-first applications based on hierarchical data, like the data found on most websites. Can be used as the backend for websites, web applications, mobile applications or platforms containing all of them. KusiKusi also ~~has~~ (will have) tools to build static websites. 

Kusikusi is not reinventing the wheel, it is built on top of Lumen Framework by Laravel, so, it can be deployed on almost any hosting provider using PHP and MySQL. KusiKusi has its own way to organize models and its relations, mainly tree based relations.
